currently model and viewModel is defined in ROME, but will be handled by ROME, which means they will be saved as ROME way (into our database as definied data type).
but the workflow model is created and queryed by workflow web modeler or workflow engine, means we can define those model in ROME, but it's readonly for ROME, and we also 
need cusomize those model's loading and query method (also in rest api, which I am not sure core web API can do that or not.
